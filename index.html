    <div class="quotes">
        <p>it's wonderful that the production of this soap supports the local community and that the ingredients are native to NZ</p>
        <p>I love discovering businesses founded by passionate individuals who are dedicated to minimising harm, respecting people and the planets and creating with care. Aotea embodies all of those attributes and entwines them with a sense of community and culture.</p>
        <p>A wonderful example of a company embracing it's cultural and local community, spreading awareness, goodwill and social responsibility. Love the concept of tikanga maori and educating the consumer about the maori ways.</p>
        <p>I buy the Aotea range because of their commitment to sustainability. Their facilities on Aotea are powered by a solar farm and I'm excited to see how they turn their business into a complete circular economy</p>

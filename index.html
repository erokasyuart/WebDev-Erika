                Tātai is a place where Māori can share iwi affiliations, with iwi, and the Ministry of Health, to make a positive difference today, and for future generations. It is a data collection tool that will provide iwi with much better health information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sharing your iwi affiliations is a way to ensure we, as Māori, are contributing to worthwhile and high-quality datasets about iwi, for iwi. Tātai has been created in partnership with Māori, for Māori.

            About
        </h1>
        <p>The Government has struggled to provide iwi with high quality health information about their people, but knows that needs to change.</p>
        <p>With good health information iwi can influence and advocate for a health system that keeps people healthy and supports us all to deliver greater equity for Māori.</p>
        <p>With good health information iwi can make data informed decisions around how to invest in the wellbeing of iwi, hapū and whānau.</p>
        <p>Sharing your iwi affiliations with us contributes to a dataset that can be used to maximise our potential as Māori.</p>
